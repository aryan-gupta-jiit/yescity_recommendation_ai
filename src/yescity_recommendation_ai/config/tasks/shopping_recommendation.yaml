#   TASK: Find shopping places in {cityName} that match the user's request: {user_query_details}

#   === CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY ===
  
#   STEP 1: Use the search_shopping_places tool with ONLY cityName="{cityName}"
  
#   STEP 2: You will receive a list of ALL shops in {cityName}. For example:
#   [
#     {{
#       "_id": "68c7f27e20f4dc4834768b6d",
#       "shops": "JDS Banaras",
#       "famousFor": "Sarees",
#       "priceRange": "₹10,000–₹3,65,000+",
#       "flagship": true,
#       "premium": "A",
#       ... (other fields)
#     }},
#     ... more shops
#   ]
  
#   STEP 3: Analyze each shop's data to find matches for what the user wants:
#   - Look at the "shops" field (shop name)
#   - Look at the "famousFor" field (what they sell)
#   - Consider "flagship" (true = premium establishment)
#   - Consider "premium" ("A" = top quality)
  
#   STEP 4: Select the TOP 1-3 most relevant shops that match the user's request
  
#   STEP 5: Return ONLY the JSON with their _id and shops names - NOTHING ELSE
  
#   === YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE EXACTLY THIS FORMAT ===
#   {
#     "recommendations": [
#       {"_id": "68c7f27e20f4dc4834768b6d", "shops": "JDS Banaras"},
#       {"_id": "another_id_here", "shops": "Another Shop Name"}
#     ]
#   }
  
#   === RULES ===
#   - DO NOT include any explanations, comments, or code
#   - DO NOT write tutorials or examples
#   - DO NOT describe what you're doing
#   - JUST return the JSON object above
#   - If no shops match, return: {"recommendations": []}

# expected_output: |
#   A JSON object with the exact structure:
#   {
#     "recommendations": [
#       {"_id": "68c7f27e20f4dc4834768b6d", "shops": "JDS Banaras"},
#       {"_id": "68c7f27e20f4dc4834768b6e", "shops": "ALBELI"}
#     ]
#   }

#   Rules:
#   1. Each recommendation must have _id (as string) and shops
#   2. Maximum 3 recommendations, minimum 1 if matches found
#   3. If no matches found, return empty array: {"recommendations": []}
#   4. Do not include any other text or explanation - JUST THE JSON
